Unit 17 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker
For this assignment, you'll create a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the Develop folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

* User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.


* Business Context
A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.

The user should be able to:

- Add exercises to a previous workout plan.
- Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
